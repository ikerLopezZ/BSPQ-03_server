## Installation

Run the following command to compile the project:

    mvn compile

Use MySQL Workbench to open and run the SQL Script **deustoTickets.sql** in the `dbConf` directory. In this way, the "deustoTickets" database schema and the user named "spq" with password "spq" will be created, and will be granted all privileges over all the tables within the schema.

To enhance the database classes run the command:

    mvn datanucleus:enhance

Run the following command to create the database schema:

    mvn datanucleus:schema-create

Run the command

    mvn jetty:run

to run the program. 

Finally, to delete and clean all the artifacts generated by previous builds, run the command

    mvn clean

and check that the `target` directory is removed.

## Running the tests

Run the following command to run the automated tests:

    mvn test

Open the **index.html** file created in the `target\site\jacoco` directory to consult the JaCoCo code coverage verification report.

To review the performance testing reports, open the **index.html** file generated in the `target\contiperf-report` directory.

## Generating the documentation

Run the command 

    mvn doxygen:report

to generate the Doxygen documentation inside the `target\doxygen` directory.

The output formats are HTML and LaTeX. Open the **index.html** file created in the `target\doxygen\html` directory to read the documentation in HTML format.

Run the command

    make

in the `target\doxygen\latex` directory and open the created **refman.pdf** file to read the documentation in LaTeX format.
